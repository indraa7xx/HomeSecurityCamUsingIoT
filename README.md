HomeSecurityCamUsingIoT
A DIY smart security camera using an ESP32-CAM, controlled entirely through Telegram.
This Arduino sketch transforms an ESP32-CAM into a versatile, Wi-Fi-enabled security and monitoring device. It captures and sends images upon motion detection or user request, provides real-time temperature and humidity data, and allows for remote control of a connected light. Get instant photo alerts, check the environment, and even toggle a light, all from the palm of your hand!
