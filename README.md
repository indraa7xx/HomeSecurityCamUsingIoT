# HomeSecurityCamUsingIoT
This Arduino sketch transforms an ESP32-CAM into a versatile, Wi-Fi-enabled security and monitoring device controlled entirely through a Telegram bot. It captures and sends images upon motion detection or user request, provides real-time temperature and humidity data, and allows for remote control of a connected light.
